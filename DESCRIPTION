Description: Provides methods for robust estimation and outlier detection in 
    state-space models. 
    Includes functionality for fitting benchmark models, visualizing model 
    selection criteria, and evaluating in-sample and out-of-sample performance. 
    Simulation tools for generating synthetic data under a first-difference 
    correlated random walk (DCRW) model are also included. 
    Designed with flexibility for user-defined model structures via the 
    'specify_SSM()' interface.
