\title{Autoplot for Robularized State Space Model List}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{robularized_SSM_list}(object, attribute = "BIC", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class `robularized_SSM_list` as returned by \code{\link{robularized_SSM}} when multiple \eqn{\lambda} values are used.}

\item{attribute}{A character string indicating which model attribute to plot. Options include `lambda`, `prop_outlying`, `BIC`, `loglik`, `RSS`, `iterations`, `value`, and `counts`. Defaults to `BIC`.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to specific methods. Not used in this method.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the trajectory of the specified attribute across \eqn{\lambda}.
}
\description{
Generates a diagnostic plot for a list of robust state space models fit across a sequence of \eqn{\lambda} values. The plot displays the specified model attribute (e.g., BIC, proportion outlying, log-likelihood) against \eqn{\lambda}, with a vertical dashed line indicating the model with the lowest BIC among those with fewer than 50\% outliers.
}
\details{
The red dashed vertical line indicates the model with the lowest BIC among models with less than 50\% outlying time points, as a heuristic for robust model selection.
