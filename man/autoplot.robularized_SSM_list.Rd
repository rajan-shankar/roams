\title{Autoplot for Robularized State Space Model Grid}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{robularized_SSM_list}(model_list, attribute = "BIC")
}
\arguments{
\item{model_list}{An object of class `"robularized_SSM_list"` as returned by [robularized_SSM()] when multiple \eqn{\lambda} values are used.}

\item{attribute}{A character string indicating which model attribute to plot. Options include `"lambda"`, `"prop_outlying"`, `"BIC"`, `"loglik"`, `"RSS"`, `"iterations"`, `"value"`, and `"counts"`. Defaults to `"BIC"`.}
}
\value{
A `ggplot` object showing the trajectory of the specified attribute across \eqn{\lambda}.
}
\description{
Generates a diagnostic plot for a list of robust state space models fit across a grid of \eqn{\lambda} values. The plot displays the specified model attribute (e.g., BIC, log-likelihood, proportion of outliers) against \eqn{\lambda}, with an optional vertical dashed line indicating the model with the lowest BIC among those with fewer than 45% outliers.
}
\details{
The red dashed vertical line indicates the model with the lowest BIC among models with less than 45% outlying time points, as a heuristic for robust model selection.
