\title{Autoplot for Robularized State Space Model List}
\usage{
\method{autoplot}{robularized_SSM_list}(object, attribute1 = "BIC", attribute2 = "prop_outlying", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{robularized_SSM_list} as returned by \code{\link{robularized_SSM}} when multiple \eqn{\lambda} values are used.}

\item{attribute1}{A character string indicating the first model attribute to plot on the top panel. Options include \code{"lambda"}, \code{"prop_outlying"}, \code{"BIC"}, \code{"loglik"}, \code{"RSS"}, \code{"iterations"}, \code{"value"}, and \code{"counts"}. Defaults to \code{"BIC"}.}

\item{attribute2}{A character string indicating the second model attribute to plot on the bottom panel. Uses the same options as \code{attribute1}. Defaults to \code{"prop_outlying"}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to specific methods. Not used in this method.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot} object arranged using the \pkg{patchwork} package, showing the specified attributes plotted against \eqn{\lambda} in two vertically stacked panels.
}
\description{
Generates diagnostic plots for a list of robust state space models fit across a sequence of \eqn{\lambda} values. Two model attributes are plotted against \eqn{\lambda}, each in its own panel, with a vertical dashed line indicating the model with the lowest BIC among those with fewer than 50\% outliers.
}
\details{
In each panel, a red dashed vertical line indicates the model with the lowest BIC among those with fewer than 50\% outlying time points, serving as a heuristic for robust model selection.
