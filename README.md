# roams

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of roams is to provide methods for robust estimation and
outlier detection in state-space models. It includes functionality for
fitting benchmark models, visualizing model selection criteria, and
evaluating in-sample and out-of-sample performance. Simulation tools for
generating synthetic data under a first-difference correlated random
walk (DCRW) model are also included. Designed with flexibility for
user-defined model structures via the `specify_SSM()` interface.

## Installation

You can install the development version of roams from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("rajan-shankar/roams")
```
